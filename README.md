## About LabFREED

Many concerns of software for laboratories should be solved on a **per-lab** instead of a **per-vendor** basis.  
That‚Äôs why contributors from across the community are publishing open building blocks as part of the LabFREED initiative:

- **PAC-ID** ‚Üí Standardized Representation for Identifiers Across System Borders  
- **PAC-ID Resolver** ‚Üí Service Discovery and Seamless User Handovers  
- **T-REX** ‚Üí QR/DataMatrix Optimized Data Serialization  

Together, these *Smart Building Blocks* aim to reduce vendor lock-in and accelerate lab digitalization.
